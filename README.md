# Banker's Algorithm
The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that is used in operating systems. It was developed by Edsger W. Dijkstra and named in honor of the banker's dilemma of lending and borrowing. The algorithm is designed to avoid deadlock by determining whether granting a resource request will leave the system in a safe state.

# Page Replacement Algorithms
Page replacement algorithms are used in operating systems to manage memory efficiently by replacing pages in memory. Two common page replacement algorithms are:

1) FIFO (First-In-First-Out) Page Replacement Algorithm
2) LRU (Least Recently Used) Page Replacement Algorithm
